# ASPIRE Lab
Welcome to the lab website.

The ASPIRE Lab advances the science and engineering of autonomous robotic systems capable of perceiving, learning, and acting intelligently in complex and uncertain environments. Our research spans a wide range of robotic platforms — from swarms of aerial drones for cooperative payload transport to quadruped, biped, and humanoid robots, as well as flexible manipulators designed for dynamic interaction and adaptability.

Ongoing projects explore hybrid aerial–aquatic drones, underwater robots, wheeled mobile robots, and biomimetic systems inspired by nature. Our core focus lies in integrating conventional control theory with learning-based paradigms such as reinforcement learning and deep learning, enabling robots to make adaptive, data-driven decisions in real time.

We also emphasize robot vision and visual servoing as key enablers of perception-guided autonomy — allowing robots to interpret and interact with their surroundings through advanced sensing and intelligent control.

At ASPIRE, we strive to bridge the gap between model-based design and data-driven intelligence, developing the next generation of autonomous systems for exploration, interaction, and real-world deployment.
